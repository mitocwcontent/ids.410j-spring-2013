To give you an opportunity to measure your learning progress, you will be asked to complete several online quizzes. These will help you identify what topics and readings you might need to revisit, and help the teaching team to see whether any concepts need further discussion in class. To encourage you to complete the quizzes, without being punitive, each will be worth one percentage point of your participation grade.
