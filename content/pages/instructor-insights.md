Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _IDS.410J Modeling and Assessment for Policy_ as it was taught by Prof. Noelle Selin in Spring 2013.

_Modeling and Assessment for Policy_ is a graduate course that introduces students to tools and strategies for technically-focused policy analysis. The course is cross-listed with the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences](./resolveuid/7df4dc8c0cb62d722230b25ff57ca9cb), and draws examples from modeling of earth and environmental systems.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Understand and apply tools and techniques used for technically-focused policy analysis
*   Identify best practices and limitations in using quantitative models for policy
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of scientific and technical advice in policy-making processes
*   Describe and analyze strategies to manage scientific and technical advice processes
*   Communicate technical results to policy audiences

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

*   Ongoing research in areas of modeling e.g. science, engineering, economics
*   Careers in interpreting scientific results for decision-making

Curriculum Information
